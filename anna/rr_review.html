Justin and Anna have a relationship that's "on the rocks," but Justin can't accept this.
He has no confidence in the usual methods: begging, pleading, sending roses. Perhaps he also feels
that these suggestions don't express the poetry of their love. He wants to get her back by magic.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Century Schoolbook">
If only he had a lock of her hair.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Century Schoolbook">
The 10 minutes of <i>anna in the sky</i> show Justin's attempts to get a lock of her hair
and to perform a ritual. The lengths he's willing to go to. As we watch him, we hear
his narration, his rationalizations, his superb unwillingness to let reality interfere.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Century Schoolbook">
A short film isn't just a long film that didn't grow up. It's a different kind of thing
altogether. It's like a short story. Or like a lyric poem. We don't wonder if maybe John Donne
started out intending <i>A Valediciton Forbidding Mourning</i> to be as long as <i>Paradise Lost</i>
but then couldn't find financial backing so he had to settle for a poem that could print on
a page and a half. The <i>Valediction</i> couldn't have been much longer than it is, because
too much of its effect depends on being able to read it all at once and to hold it
complete in your mind. It's designed to be condensed, so it burns ideas with a reckless intensity.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Century Schoolbook">
<i>anna in the sky</i> illustrates this observation perfectly. It "burns ideas with a reckless
intensity" to sustain lyrically our sense of Justin's passion, or madness.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Century Schoolbook">
Justin wants to sneak into Anna's apartment, so he rings her bell, quickly runs downstairs to
hide, sees that she doesn't answer, and runs back up (observed by a neighbor
across the street) to let himself in with the key. This is shot with a wide-angle lens held
at just the right distance and angle so that the tall, skinny actor, Danny Maloney, seems
almost elastic as he bounds up and down the stairs. The rhythm of it--walk up the stairs
and ring the bell, run down, wait, run (with interruption from neighbor) back up again--is
perfect, as is the clear, elegant combination of visual and narrative ideas.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Century Schoolbook">
If you were to drive to a theater, pay regular price for tickets, and do nothing but
watch the 10 minutes of <i>anna in the sky</i> before driving home again,
you would probably think you got a really good deal.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Century Schoolbook">
An excellent film.
