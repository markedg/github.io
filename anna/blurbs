In a series of home-brewed rituals aimed at winning back sweet Anna's love, 
our lovelorn narrator takes the audience on a seemingly
innocent stalk of his former lover. The journey becomes an emotional 
exercise in voyeurism which not only insists that we too miss Anna
when she's gone, and makes us wonder what we'd do to have her back.
