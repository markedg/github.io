<h1>The Balaton Monks</h1>
<h3>Dialogue List in English</h3>
<div><img src="images/Sopron.jpg"/></div>
<div class="dialogue_list">
<p><span class="speaker">Isti</span>: Did she give you the old "We're better as friends?" Or "I just need a little
space right now?" ... I'll take a photo, okay?  This one's nice.  I know it's painful now, but in a couple of years
you'll be glad to have a record of it.</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Dávid</span>: C'mon guys, we've all been dumped by girls before.</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Isti</span>: True enough.</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Dávid</span>: Andrew, you need to embrace your monkhood, like us.  Join the monastery; am I 
right, Brother Isti?</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Isti</span>: I don't know if we want any Sad Sack monks; he's kind of bringing me down.</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Dávid</span>: No, no, you're wrong -- Andrew just needs time for reflection.  It might be 
time for a spiritual retreat.</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Isti</span>: Balaton-style?</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Dávid</span>: Could be.</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Isti</span>: Don't worry, the initiation isn't that bad.</p>
<p><span class="description">Music.</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Isti</span>: Was that really necessary?  I hope I won't have to look at your sad face all
weekend long. Okay, you broke up; I understand that you loved her, but apart from that, you should be happy that it's
finally over with that girl.  She wasn't a good match for you; you just suffered in this relationship -- it didn't 
work, and you have to accept it.  I understand she was a babe and you had the hots for her, but I'm telling, seriously:
I never really liked her.</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Andrew</span>: Shut the fuck up.</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Dávid</span>: Alright, certain topics are off-limit this weekend: the first one is Dori. And
women in general.</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Andrew</span>: Amen.</p>
<p><span class="description">Music.</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Dávid</span>: Bianka?</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Bianka</span>: Hi Dávid!</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Dávid</span>: Hi, are you camping here?</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Bianka</span>: No, we just came for a swim. I'm staying at my grandparents' house -- just up
the hill.</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Dávid</span>: You know Isti and Andrew?</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Bianka</span>: Yes, of course. Hi!</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Isti</span>: Hello.</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Andrew</span>: Hi.</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Bianka</span>: How's Dori?</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Andrew</span>: Well...</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Isti</span>: Bad news.</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Bianka</span>: Oh no; did you break up?</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Isti</span>: That's why we're out here: to try to get his mind off it.</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Bianka</span>: How long are you staying?</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Dávid</span>: Just for the weekend; do a little fishing, maybe some hiking.</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Bianka</span>: Sounds fun.</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Isti</span>: Are you around?</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Bianka</span>: Yeah; I'm just up there babysitting most of the time, but you should stop
by if you want to. Look for the house with the basketball hoop.</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Isti</span>: Alright.</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Bianka</span>: Well, we have to get back for dinner. See ya!</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Isti</span>: What?</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Dávid</span>: What are you looking at?</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Isti</span>: Looking is allowed.</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Dávid</span>: We're monks, remember?</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Isti</span>: Even monks can look.</p>

<p><span class="description">Fishing.</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Dávid</span>: What are they using over there? Can you see?</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Isti</span>: This place sucks; I'm gonna try on the other side.</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Dávid</span>: At this rate, we're not going to have anything at all to eat tonight. I'm gonna
see if I can find a grocery store around here.</p>

<p><span class="description">Bianka's house.</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Andrew</span>: Hi Bianka!</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Bianka</span>: Are you having a good trip?</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Andrew</span>: It's okay.</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Bianka</span>: Is it helping you get over your breakup with Dori?</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Andrew</span>: It's hard. Isti and Dávid both have girlfriends, so it's hard for them to 
understand what it's like to be alone. Do you have a boyfriend?</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Bianka</span>: No, no.</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Andrew</span>: So you probably understand better than they do.</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Bianka</span>: You think so? ... Do you want something to drink? Cola, Fanta, orange juice?</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Andrew</span>: A cola would be good.</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Bianka</span>: Alright, have a seat; and keep an eye on Gillian for me, okay?</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Isti</span>: Hey asshole!</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Andrew</span>: Who's there?</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Bianka</span>: Where's Gillian?</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Dávid</span>: Hi Bianka!</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Bianka</span>: Oh, here you are, Gilli!</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Isti</span>: What are you doing here?</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Andrew</span>: I thought you were fishing; and I thought <i>you</i> went to get groceries.</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Dávid</span>: I was going to, but then the campground office said you had a message.</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Andrew</span>: A message? From who?</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Dávid</span>: Dori.</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Andrew</span>: From Dori!? What'd she say?</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Dávid</span>: I didn't read it; anyway, what do you care?</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Andrew</span>: I should probably go down and see what she wants.</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Bianka</span>: You don't want your cola?</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Andrew</span>: No thanks; I gotta get going.</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Dávid</span>: See ya, Bia.</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Bianka</span>: Bye.</p>

<p><span class="description">On the road.</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Andrew</span>: I wonder what she wants.</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Dávid</span>: Forget about her, she's bad news.</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Andrew</span>: Maybe she's changed her mind, who knows.</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Dávid</span>: Look, Andrew, there's no message; we just made that up.</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Andrew</span>: You fuckers! Why'd you tell me there was a message?</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Isti</span>: Why'd you tell Bianka we had girlfriends?</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Andrew</span>: I knew it! You guys were spying on me!</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Dávid</span>: Well, it seems to have been justified.</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Andrew</span>: I'm the one who needs comfort; didn't we come here for my sake?</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Isti</span>: Don't pull that shit; I knew Bianka first anyway.</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Dávid</span>: What does that matter? I know her better than either of you.</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Isti</span>: It's about priority.</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Dávid</span>: Fuck your priority.</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Andrew</span>: But I'm the one who's hurting!</p>

<p><span class="description">Fishing.</span></p>
<p><span class="speaker">Fisherman</span>: How's fishing?</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Isti</span>: Shit.</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Bianka</span>: Any luck?</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Dávid</span>: Not too bad.</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Isti</span>: Yeah, pretty good actually.</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Bianka</span>: Well, we're going swimming if anyone wants to join us.</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Isti</span>: Okay.</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Bianka</span>: Bye.</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Dávid</span>: You know that Zen Buddhist monks can have wives?</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Isti</span>: And girlfriends too?</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Dávid</span>: I guess.</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Andrew</span>: And sex?</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Isti</span>: That's my kind of monastery.</p>
